# Image Slider with Gallery Navigation

This is a simple image slider built with vanilla JavaScript.  
It displays a main slider area with previous/next buttons, and a gallery of thumbnails below to navigate between images.

## 📌 Features

- Image slider with smooth transitions
- Next and Previous navigation buttons
- Thumbnail gallery to select any image directly
- Active image highlighting in both slider and gallery
- Automatically disables buttons at start and end of the slider

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS (Grid)
- JavaScript (vanilla)

## 📂 How It Works

1. The slider is a list of images, and the gallery below shows the same images as thumbnails.
2. Clicking on gallery thumbnails updates the main slider image.
3. Next and Previous buttons let you move through the images.
4. The current active image is highlighted in the gallery.
5. The gallery layout is generated dynamically by cloning the slider images using JavaScript.

## 🚀 How to Use

- Add your images inside the `.slider` container in HTML.
- The gallery thumbnails will be generated automatically.
- Make sure to give all slider images the class `slider img`.
- The gallery container must have the class `.gallery`.
